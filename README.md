I have various experiences with coding, first of all I have learnt python mostly because it is a part of A levels Computer Science course, other than that, I have made personal projects involving HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, which are mostly stream elements for twitch streamers that I have sold to clients

**_I would love to learn cyber security further_**
1. First of all finishing tryhackme pre-security and cyber security 101 roadmap
2. Do HackTheBox boxes to test my cyber security skills
3. OverTheWire cyber security mini games to also test my skills
